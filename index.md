# VLPB Assembly Workshop

## Location and travel
By invitation only!

Jun 7-8, 2022 - Delft Lecture room F206 - building 22
Workshop is in English
 

# Tools and preparation
This is a bring your own machine workshop.

A pre-packaged conda environment will be available 1 week in advance

You will need a laptop with a linux-like environment available that can run the pre-packaged environment with its tools. You can use any linux-like environment: WSL2, linux, Mac, VM or a remote system. Must support conda environment mentioned above
