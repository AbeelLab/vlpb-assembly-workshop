# VLPB Assembly Workshop

## Location and travel
By invitation only!

Jun 7-8, 2022 - Delft Lecture room F206 - building 22
Workshop is in English
 

## Tools and preparation
This is a bring your own machine workshop.

A pre-packaged conda environment will be available 1 week in advance

You will need to have a with a linux-like environment available that can run the pre-packaged environment with its tools. You can use any linux-like environment: WSL2, linux, Mac, VM or a remote system. Must support conda environment mentioned above
 
## Schedule

### June 7 -- Assembly in the context of haplotypes
 
Topics: 
	• Assembly algorithm theory: de Brujn graphs and overlap-layout-consensus
	• Assembly evaluation+polishing+(scaffolding)
	 
Exercises:
	• Miniasm+Flye assembly: long reads/short reads
	• Assembly evaluation (Quast+BUSCO)
	• Assembly visualization (GenomeView), includes read-alignment to assemblies

8:45 arrival
9:00 start
9:00-9:45 assembly lecture part 1
10:00-10:45 assembly lecture part 2

###June 8 -- Haplotype phasing
Topics:
· Haplotype phasing theory
· Haplotype phasing evaluation
			· Different metrics and their interpretation
			· Maybe scripts?
			· Hamming rate/switch error >> accuracy due to improvements in algorithms
					· (might be a good master project)
·  
 
Exercises
· HAT and nPhase haplotype phasing on tetraploid simulated genome
· Haplotype phasing evaluation
· Haplotype phasing visualization (GenomeView)
			· Alignment of reads to reconstructed haplotypes
· Alignment of haplotypes (Mauve)
